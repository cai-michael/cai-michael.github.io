      C#/Python Developer with experience developing microservices and deploying
      them to Kubernetes and Service Fabric clusters. I've worked on cloud
      applications primarily using Azure products with a bit of experience in
      AWS.

    I'm primarily a backend service developer, the majority of my programming
    language experience is in <b>C#</b> and <b>Python</b> but I have used
    <b>Java</b>, <b>PowerShell</b>, and <b>Go</b> in smaller projects. In my
    limited experience with frontend projects, usually for personal use, I've
    written <b>Angular</b> apps using <b>TypeScript</b>, <b>HTML</b>, and
    <b>CSS</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The majority of my development experience has been working on microservices
    that use <b>REST APIs</b> in <b>.NET</b>. I've created a static code
    analyzer using <b>Roslyn</b> with automated code fixes (in a bit of a parody
    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StyleCop">StyleCop</a> my analyzer
    was named VogueDeputy). I often write small scripts for data analysis and
    sometimes <b>Jupyter Notebooks</b> for visualization.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy building and working with automation, regularly working with
    <b>YAML</b> to create automated build and deployment pipelines for both
    <b>Azure Pipelines</b> and <b>Github Actions</b>. I've also worked with
    <b>Helm</b> charts to templatize deployments to
    <b>Azure Kubernetes Service</b> as well as <b>Bicep</b> for building out
    IaC.
