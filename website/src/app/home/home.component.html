  <h2>Skills</h2>
  <p>I'm primarily an application or backend developer, the majority of my programming language experience is in <b>C#</b> and <b>Python</b> but I have used <b>Java</b>, <b>PowerShell</b>, and <b>Go</b> in smaller projects. In my limited experience with frontend projects, usually for personal use, I've written <b>Angular</b> apps using <b>TypeScript</b>, <b>HTML</b>, and <b>CSS</b>.</p>
  <p>I work on <b>Service Fabric</b> and <b>Kubernetes</b> applications in <b>.NET</b> such as <b>REST APIs</b>. I've created a static code analyzer using <b>Roslyn</b> with automated code fixes. I often write small scripts and sometimes write <b>Jupyter Notebooks</b> to visualize data.</p>
  <p>I enjoy building and working with automation, regularly working with <b>YAML</b> to create automated build and deployment pipelines for both <b>Azure Pipelines</b> and <b>Github Actions</b>. I've also worked with <b>Helm</b> charts to template deployments to <b>Azure Kubernetes Service</b>.</p>
